# ES6 - Basics

ES6 or ECMA2015 is a standard of JavaScript that introduced rich features in havascript such as:
- Block scoping of variables using const and let
- Arrow functions
- for/of looping
- classes to provide a blueprint for objects
- promises, and more others.

This project is the first in the Short Specialization Program in Backend by ALX. In files listed here, we interact closely with these features of ES6.
